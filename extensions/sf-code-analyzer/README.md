# SF Code Analyzer — Code Walkthrough

## What It Does

SF Code Analyzer gives pi a Salesforce Code Analyzer workflow surface. It wraps
the supported `sf code-analyzer` CLI commands with:

- `/sf-code-analyzer` shortcut into the SF Pi Manager detail page, with status, doctor, setup, automation, ApexGuru, recipes, and help actions
- one `code_analyzer` LLM tool with `doctor`, `run`, `rules`, `config`,
  `apexguru`, and `last_report` actions
- session-scoped report artifacts outside the project tree by default
- `/sf-pi doctor` contribution for setup readiness
- deferred post-agent local quality scans on supported file edits
- explicit ApexGuru analysis for one Apex file when the target org supports it
- ApexGuru automatic insights that are default-on when cached org readiness is enabled
- automatic ApexGuru setup suggestions that offer SF Browser guidance only after user approval
- scoped automation preferences with project > global > default precedence
- `summary`, `inline`, and `file_only` output modes for explicit report actions
- scan recipes that explain default automatic profiles, broader explicit scans, and Herdr handoff guidance

## Runtime Flow

```text
Extension loads
  ├─ register /sf-code-analyzer
  ├─ register /sf-pi doctor provider
  └─ session_start
       ├─ if extension enabled, register code_analyzer tool
       ├─ schedule deferred readiness-cache refresh
       └─ collect changed write/edit targets for post-agent scans

agent_settled
  ├─ if changed supported files exist and cached readiness is ready
  ├─ run one bounded local Code Analyzer scan
  ├─ emit human-visible transcript row
  └─ send bounded LLM follow-up only when actionable findings exist

code_analyzer action='run'
  ├─ create JSON report path under <globalAgentDir>/sf-pi/code-analyzer/
  ├─ run sf code-analyzer run --output-file <report>.json
  ├─ parse JSON report when present
  └─ return bounded LLM summary + report path in details
```

## Key Architecture Decisions

- **CLI-first boundary** — SF Pi shells out to `sf code-analyzer` and parses
  output files instead of importing Code Analyzer core or engine packages. See
  ADR 0020.
- **Quality-biased feedback** — LLM feedback includes enough violation detail to
  act, while full reports stay as artifacts. See ADR 0022.
- **No shadow rule config** — `code-analyzer.yml` remains the upstream source of
  truth for rule and engine configuration. See ADR 0025.
- **Default-enabled, readiness-gated** — setup recommendations are cache-first;
  scans run only when prerequisites are ready. See ADR 0024.
- **Deferred quality pass** — automatic local scans wait until Pi reports the
  agent has settled after any automatic retry, compaction retry, or queued
  follow-up. See ADR 0021.
- **ApexGuru boundary** — explicit ApexGuru is available now; automatic ApexGuru
  is cache-first and default-on when cached availability is enabled. When ApexGuru
  is unavailable, SF Pi suggests checking Setup with SF Browser but does not
  open or mutate Setup without user approval. See ADR 0026.

## User Guide

### What runs automatically?

`sf-code-analyzer` watches successful pi `write` and `edit` tool results for
supported files. It does **not** watch arbitrary editor saves or shell-created
files. After Pi reports the agent has settled, the extension runs a
readiness-gated deferred scan for changed files:

| Changed file type                     | Automatic selector   |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Apex classes, triggers, `.apex` files | `pmd:Recommended`    |
| JavaScript / TypeScript               | `eslint:Recommended` |
| Flow metadata (`*.flow-meta.xml`)     | `flow:Recommended`   |

Automatic scans are intentionally narrow. They are fast quality checks for the
files the agent just touched, not replacements for full-project, AppExchange, or
CI scans.

### `Recommended` is not `all`

The default explicit run uses Code Analyzer's `Recommended` selector:

```json
{ "action": "run", "rule_selector": ["Recommended"], "workspace": ["."] }
```

That is different from an exhaustive scan:

```json
{ "action": "run", "rule_selector": ["all"], "workspace": ["."] }
```

Use `all` only when you explicitly want broad/noisy coverage, usually in a
Herdr lane or CI-style validation.

### Recipes and broader suggestions

`code_analyzer action='recipes'` lists named scan recipes. Recipes are metadata
only: they explain the selector and workflow, but never execute a scan by
themselves.

Common explicit recipes:

| Recipe        | Selector                | When to use                                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `security`    | `Recommended:Security`  | Auth, CRUD/FLS, sharing, dynamic SOQL, callouts, secrets, crypto, guest/Experience work |
| `appexchange` | `AppExchange`           | Managed package, ISV, AppExchange security review preparation                           |
| `all-rules`   | `all`                   | Exhaustive pre-release or CI hardening                                                  |
| `retire-js`   | `retire-js:Recommended` | Dependency manifest or lockfile changes                                                 |
| `cpd`         | `cpd:Recommended`       | Broad refactors or duplicate-code checks                                                |
| `sfge`        | `sfge:Recommended`      | Apex data-flow or security-sensitive SOQL/DML paths                                     |

When changed files look security-sensitive or broad, the automatic scan can emit
a compact suggestion such as:

```text
💡 Broader scan suggestions (not run automatically):
- security: Security-focused scan — rule_selector Recommended:Security (Herdr recommended)
```

These suggestions are educational. The extension does not run broader recipes
automatically.

### Herdr handoff

Long-running recipes include plan-focused Herdr Workflow Handoff metadata and
text guidance. If a recipe says Herdr is recommended and `sf_herdr_plan` is
available, the agent should call `sf_herdr_plan` visibly before running the
broad scan. The handoff carries plan intent and workflow context, not shell
commands. The Code Analyzer extension does not invoke Herdr internally and does
not create panes on its own.

### ApexGuru

ApexGuru is org-backed, not a local Code Analyzer engine. It requires a target
org whose ApexGuru service is enabled for the current org/user. When unavailable,
SF Pi can suggest an SF Browser setup check, but it will not open Setup or click
Enable/Accept/Save without user approval.

Use:

```json
{ "action": "apexguru", "target": ["force-app/main/default/classes/MyClass.cls"] }
```

To see the HIL-gated browser setup runbook:

```json
{ "action": "apexguru_setup_help" }
```

### Result cards, facts, and artifacts

`code_analyzer` renders its own foreground-color result cards instead of using
Pi's default success/error tool background shell. The card is presentation only:
execution still flows through `CodeAnalyzerReportSummary`, and full evidence stays
in report artifacts. Report-shaped actions also expose a compact
`details.sfCodeAnalyzer.facts` object with severity counts, top findings, top
rules, top files, and fixable count so agents can audit and iterate without
parsing prose. The sibling `details.sfCodeAnalyzer.report` summary carries the
command and report path.

For `run`, `rules`, `config`, and `last_report`, use:

| Output mode | Behavior                                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `summary`   | Bounded default detail plus artifact path           |
| `inline`    | Richer truncated detail plus artifact path          |
| `file_only` | Minimal prompt output with counts and artifact path |

Full JSON/YAML/HTML/SARIF outputs are preserved as report artifacts. By default,
SF Pi writes its own artifacts under the global agent directory rather than the
project tree. User-supplied `output_files` are passed directly to Code Analyzer.

### Automation settings

`/sf-code-analyzer` exposes project and global controls for:

- deferred auto-scan;
- ApexGuru auto insights.

Project settings override global settings, which override extension defaults.
Use project overrides when a repository needs stricter or quieter automation
than your global default. These two low-friction settings are editable from
**SF Pi Manager → SF Code Analyzer → Settings**:

- **Deferred auto-scan** (`sfPi.codeAnalyzer.autoScan`) — runs readiness-gated local scans after agent edits.
- **ApexGuru auto insights** (`sfPi.codeAnalyzer.apexGuruAuto`) — suggests ApexGuru insights automatically when cached org readiness allows it.

The same preferences remain available as quick Manager detail actions. In the
SF Pi Manager detail page, press `S` to switch the active Manager scope; scoped
automation actions render once and apply to the selected global or project
scope.

## Testing Strategy

Run:

```bash
npm test -- extensions/sf-code-analyzer/tests
npm run check
```

- `display.test.ts` covers the quality-biased finding selection and report
  summary text.
- `smoke.test.ts` verifies the extension and tool modules export their entry
  points.
- CLI execution is wrapped behind `ExecFn` so later slices can add focused unit
  tests without shelling out.

## Troubleshooting

**`code_analyzer doctor` says the plugin is missing:**
Run `sf plugins install code-analyzer`, then rerun `/sf-code-analyzer doctor`.

**PMD, CPD, or SFGE rules fail:**
Install Java 11 or later. The doctor output shows Java readiness.

**Flow Scanner rules fail:**
Install Python 3.10 or later. The doctor output checks `python3` and `python`.

**A scan wrote files I did not expect:**
By default SF Pi writes its own JSON report under the global SF Pi artifact
directory. User-supplied `output_files` are passed directly to Code Analyzer and
can write into the project if requested.
