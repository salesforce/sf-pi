> (b) disable this extension via `/sf-pi disable sf-llm-gateway-internal`.

This document explains the design and runtime flow of the Salesforce LLM Gateway
provider extension. Read this before making changes.

## What It Does

Registers the gateway as a single unified Pi-native provider and routes
Claude vs non-Claude traffic to the transport each family was designed for.
Supports dynamic model discovery, monthly budget tracking, runtime beta
header toggling, additive vs exclusive scoped-model behavior, a TUI setup
wizard, and an in-app "paste your token" flow under `/login` (pi ≥ 0.72).

## Key Architecture: One Provider, Two Transports

Since R1·Unify the extension registers a single Pi provider (`sf-llm-gateway-
internal`) with a friendly display label `SF LLM Gateway (Salesforce Internal)`.
Every model is registered under the provider-level `openai-completions` API so
pi always invokes the provider's custom `streamSimple` dispatcher. Claude models
also carry a per-model `baseUrl` pinned to the gateway root (pi ≥ 0.72), so the
dispatcher only has to switch the request model to `api: "anthropic-messages"`
and forward to the matching shim:

| Model family             | Pi-registered API    | Runtime transport          | Base URL used                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemini / GPT / Codex     | `openai-completions` | `streamSfGatewayOpenAI`    | `<gateway>/v1`                                     |
| Claude (Opus/Sonnet/...) | `openai-completions` | `streamSfGatewayAnthropic` | `<gateway>` (Anthropic SDK appends `/v1/messages`) |

Claude runs on the native Anthropic Messages path because LiteLLM's
OpenAI-compat translator splits Claude thinking + text across multiple
choices and intermittently drops the final text delta on `choices[0]`,
producing an empty assistant turn that required users to type "continue"
to unstick the agent loop. Native Anthropic streaming avoids that entire
class of failure. Non-Claude families behave correctly on OpenAI-compat
and stay there.

### Why one provider?

The earlier layout registered two providers (`sf-llm-gateway-internal` and
`sf-llm-gateway-internal-anthropic`) so they appeared as two separate rows
in pi's `/login` menu. Both used the same gateway and the same token, which
confused end users. Unifying collapses `/login` to one row and unlocks a
clean `oauth.onPrompt` paste-token flow.

### Legacy settings migration

On the first session after upgrade, `lib/migrate-unify-provider.ts`
rewrites any residual references to the retired
`sf-llm-gateway-internal-anthropic` provider in the user's pi
`settings.json` (global + project):

- `defaultProvider`
- `defaultModel` (prefix rewrite)
- `enabledModels` (drops `sf-llm-gateway-internal-anthropic/*`)

The migration is idempotent: a per-file sentinel under `sfPi.gatewayUnifyMigrated`
short-circuits subsequent sessions. Users see no prompt and no manual step.

## Transport shims

`lib/transport.ts` hosts focused wrappers on top of the pi-ai transports:

1. **Codex** (`streamSfGatewayOpenAI`). Flattens Chat Completions tools into
   the Responses tool shape LiteLLM expects for Codex, and clamps
   `reasoning_effort` to the `low|medium|high` values the gateway currently
   accepts. Non-Codex payloads pass straight through.

   Also: **gpt-5.5 force-strips `reasoning_effort`**. The gateway returns
   400 `"Function tools with reasoning_effort are not supported for gpt-5.5
in /v1/chat/completions. Please use /v1/responses instead."` when an
   agentic turn (which always carries tools) includes the field. `/v1/responses`
   is not exposed on this gateway — the route 302s to SSO login — so the
   only safe path is to omit the field entirely. gpt-5.5 still performs
   implicit reasoning on every turn.

2. **Anthropic stream errors** (`streamSfGatewayAnthropic`). Retries once when
   Anthropic reports a retryable SSE error before any user-visible content is
   emitted, then normalizes raw error envelopes into a concise message that
   preserves the request id.

3. **Opus 4.7 adaptive thinking** (`streamSfGatewayAnthropic`). pi-ai's
   adaptive-thinking allow-list currently only matches Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6,
   so 4.7 would otherwise fall back to budget-based thinking (which 4.7
   does not support) with a 32K-clamped output cap. The shim:
   - Forces adaptive thinking: `thinking: { type: "adaptive" }` (the only
     thinking mode 4.7 accepts).
   - Maps the caller's pi reasoning level to `output_config.effort`:
     `minimal`/`low` → `low`, `medium` → `medium`, `high` → `high`,
     `xhigh` → `xhigh` (new 4.7 tier between `high` and `max`). Unset
     falls back to `high`, which is Anthropic's documented default.
   - Scales `max_tokens` by pi reasoning level (`minimal`/`low` → 16K,
     `medium` → 32K, `high`/`xhigh` → 64K). Live probes showed that
     `max_tokens: 128000` + `effort: "max"` on heavier generations
     intermittently surfaces `api_error: Internal server error` from
     Anthropic upstream. 64K matches what the gateway advertises via
     `/v1/model/info` and keeps `xhigh` heavy-workload turns away from that
     failure window. Model hard ceiling is 128K (`OPUS_47_MODEL_MAX_TOKENS`);
     callers who need the extra headroom can override per request.
   - Strips `temperature`. Anthropic returns 400 (
     _"`temperature` may only be set to 1 when thinking is enabled or in
     adaptive mode"_) for any value ≠ 1 when adaptive thinking is on.

   Older Claude models pass straight through pi-ai's built-in per-model
   handling.

## Runtime Flow

```
Extension loads
  ├─ installWireTrace()                 ← opt-in raw gateway trace
  ├─ registerProviderIfConfigured()     ← unified provider, static catalog, synchronous
  ├─ discoverAndRegister()              ← async, fire-and-forget
  ├─ registerMessageRenderer()          ← gateway provider renderer
  ├─ registerCommand("sf-llm-gateway-internal")
  ├─ on("session_start")               → re-discover, sync defaults
  ├─ on("turn_end")                    → update footer status
  ├─ on("model_select")                → set thinking to xhigh (gateway provider)
  ├─ on("after_provider_response")     → record throttle/upstream signal (gateway provider)
  └─ on("session_shutdown")            → clear footer status + provider signal
```

## Configuration

Configuration follows a three-tier cascade:

```
env var  →  saved config  →  built-in default
```

- **Base URL**: `SF_LLM_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_BASE_URL` > saved > built-in default
- **API key**: `SF_LLM_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_API_KEY` > saved > missing
- **Saved config**: `~/.pi/agent/sf-llm-gateway-internal.json` (global),
  `.pi/sf-llm-gateway-internal.json` (project)
- **Scoped model mode**: saved config can keep gateway scope **additive**
  (prepend `sf-llm-gateway-internal/*`) or **exclusive**
  (replace scoped models with only gateway models and restore the prior scope on disable)

Project-scoped saved config overrides global. Env vars override everything.

The base URL can be configured as either the gateway root or the
OpenAI-compatible `/v1` root. Runtime endpoint helpers route chat/model
discovery through `/v1`, route Anthropic Messages through the gateway root,
and route admin calls such as `/user/info` through the gateway root.

## Zero-cost gateway billing

All models report `cost: 0` because the gateway is pre-paid. Billing is tracked
separately via the monthly usage endpoint (`/user/info`).

## Testing Strategy

Tests cover exported pure helpers. Functions that need Pi runtime context
(event handlers, command handlers, UI interactions) are tested via manual QA.

To run all unit tests: `npm test`

To run the live Codex gateway regression check:

```bash
npm run test:sf-llm-gateway-internal:codex
```

Required env vars for the live regression:

- `SF_LLM_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_BASE_URL`
- `SF_LLM_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_API_KEY`

Optional env vars:

- `SF_LLM_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_CODEX_TEST_MODEL` — defaults to `gpt-5.3-codex`
- `SF_LLM_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_CODEX_TEST_TIMEOUT_MS` — request timeout override

Exported helpers are marked with `// Exported for unit tests.` in the source.

## Doctor: `/sf-llm-gateway-internal doctor`

Run `/sf-llm-gateway-internal doctor` when the gateway appears connected but
requests fail. It is read-only and checks the configured URL, the normalized
OpenAI-compatible route, the Claude/admin root route, API key presence, model
discovery, and gateway health. It interprets common failures such as 401 auth
errors, SSO/browser redirects, and `model=v1` routing mistakes.

## Debugging: `/sf-llm-gateway-internal debug`

The gateway exposes `POST /utils/transform_request`, which echoes the exact
upstream URL, headers, and body LiteLLM would send for a given request. The
extension wraps that as a first-class command:

```
/sf-llm-gateway-internal debug <modelId> [reasoning=<level>] [tool] [adaptive]
```

Examples:

```text
/sf-llm-gateway-internal debug claude-opus-4-7 adaptive reasoning=xhigh
  → Upstream: https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
    Body:     { thinking: { type: "adaptive" }, output_config: { effort: "xhigh" }, max_tokens: 64000, ... }

/sf-llm-gateway-internal debug gpt-5 reasoning=high
  → Body:     { reasoning_effort: "high", allowed_openai_params: ["reasoning_effort"], ... }

/sf-llm-gateway-internal debug gpt-5.3-codex reasoning=medium tool
  → Upstream: https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    Body:     { reasoning: { effort: "medium", summary: "auto" }, tools: [...], ... }
```

This is the fastest way to verify that the shims are producing a payload shape
the gateway will accept, without burning tokens on a real completion.

## Debugging: wire trace

When the gateway returns empty or unexpected responses, enable the opt-in
wire trace to capture raw request/response bytes on disk:

```bash
SF_LLM_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_TRACE=1 pi
```

On activation, `lib/wire-trace.ts` wraps `globalThis.fetch` and logs one JSON
line per request, response header block, and SSE chunk to
`~/.pi/agent/sf-llm-gateway-internal.trace.jsonl`. The file is truncated on
each pi launch and filtered by the gateway base URL, so other providers'
requests pass through untouched.

The `/sf-llm-gateway-internal` status report shows a `Wire trace: ON` line
with the file path while tracing is active; the line is omitted when the
env var is not `1`.

A fetch wrapper is preferred over Pi's `onPayload` / `onChunk` hooks because
`onChunk` runs after pi-ai's SSE parser — if pi-ai drops a chunk, `onChunk`
wouldn't show it. The raw body is ground truth from the gateway.

## Troubleshooting

**Startup warning `No models match pattern "sf-llm-gateway-internal/*"`:**
Your credentials aren't configured yet, or the async model discovery hasn't
finished on this first run. The bootstrap catalog now seeds both Claude and
`gpt-5` synchronously, so this warning should not appear on a configured
gateway. If it persists, run `/sf-llm-gateway-internal refresh`.

**Gateway fails on startup or tool calls error out immediately:**
Confirm `SF_LLM_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_BASE_URL` and `SF_LLM_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_API_KEY`
are set (env vars win over saved config). Run
`/sf-llm-gateway-internal setup` for an interactive wizard,
`/sf-llm-gateway-internal doctor` for endpoint/key preflight checks, or
`/sf-llm-gateway-internal debug <model>` to inspect the exact upstream
payload LiteLLM would send.

**Claude responses appear to truncate and the agent asks you to type "continue":**
This is the pi-ai OpenAI-compat translator splitting Claude thinking + text
across multiple choices. The fix is already in place — the unified
`streamSimple` dispatcher detects Claude ids and forwards them to the native
Anthropic transport instead of the OpenAI-compat one. If you still see
truncation, confirm the selected model is a Claude id in
`/sf-llm-gateway-internal models`.

**Opus 4.7 returns `api_error: Internal server error` on heavy turns:**
Handled by the transport shim: `max_tokens` now scales by pi reasoning
level (minimal=16K … xhigh=64K) instead of unconditionally flooring at
64K, and transient mid-stream failures retry up to 3 times with
exponential backoff before bubbling. If the retry exhausts, the final
error includes an inline `Tip:` footer with next steps. For deeper
inspection, enable wire tracing (`SF_LLM_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_TRACE=1`).

**gpt-5.5 fails with `Function tools with reasoning_effort are not supported for gpt-5.5 in /v1/chat/completions. Please use /v1/responses instead.`:**
Handled by the transport shim as of this extension version: gpt-5.5
requests no longer carry `reasoning_effort` regardless of what pi's
thinking selector is set to. The model still performs implicit reasoning
(`usage.completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens > 0` on non-trivial
prompts). This gateway does not expose `/v1/responses` — probing the route
returns a 302 to an SSO login page — so we cannot pivot transports; the
only viable fix is to omit the field. If you need explicit control over
reasoning depth on a gpt-5 family model, use `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, or
`gpt-5.2`-series variants, all of which accept `reasoning_effort` + tools
on `/v1/chat/completions`.

**Footer shows `⚠` badge after a 429 or 5xx:**
`provider-telemetry.ts` parses retry-after headers and surfaces a 60s
badge. The next successful 2xx/3xx clears it. If the badge sticks, check
`/sf-llm-gateway-internal` status for the live throttle/upstream signal.

**I set `/thinking` to a different level but subsequent model switches reset it to `xhigh`:**
Fixed: `model_select` no longer silently forces `thinkingLevel: xhigh` on
every switch. `xhigh` is still the default for fresh sessions, but user
overrides stick. If you still see a reset, check your settings for an
explicit default that could be winning.

**Beta headers aren't taking effect:**
Check the active betas with `/sf-llm-gateway-internal beta`. pi-ai merges
the `anthropic-beta` header via `Object.assign`, so the shim always
includes `fine-grained-tool-streaming-2025-05-14` first to guarantee it
isn't silently dropped when you add another beta.

**Monthly-usage footer is stale or missing:**
Usage is cached for 60 seconds and refreshes automatically on every
`turn_end`; run `/sf-llm-gateway-internal refresh` to force a `/user/info`
fetch immediately. If you're using sf-welcome or sf-devbar as
consumers, they read from the shared store in `lib/common/monthly-usage/`
— the gateway must be registered and have succeeded at least once.
